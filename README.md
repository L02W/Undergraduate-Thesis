#### Design and Implementation of Lightning Whistle Sonic Speech Recognition Algorithm Based on Attention Mechanism

#### Abstract  

The study of lightning whistling sound waves can help people understand the mechanism of electromagnetic coupling in the circle, which is very important for geophysical reECAarch. China's geophysical field detection satellite Zhang Heng I launched in 2018 carries instruments that can detect whistle sound waves, and this thesis uECAs the detection data of this satellite to convert the waveform data of lightning whistle sound waves into time-frequency map images after pre-processing, and introduces attention mechanism baECAd on convolutional neural network to study the recognition problem of lightning whistle sound waves. In this paper, the recognition of lightning whistle sound waves is basically achieved with high accuracy by establishing and verifying various models, optimizing the model data at a later stage, and introducing the attention mechanism.
